## 1. Foundation Models and Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Base Models vs Fine-tuned Models

- **Base Models (Foundation Models)**: Large-scale neural networks pre-trained on vast text corpora using self-supervised learning. Examples include GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and Mistral.
    - Training objectives typically include next-token prediction (autoregressive models) or masked token prediction (masked language models)
    - Characterized by emergent capabilities that appear at scale without explicit training
    - Serve as general-purpose text generators with broad knowledge
- **Fine-tuned Models**: Base models further trained on specific datasets to enhance performance for particular tasks or domains.
    - **Instruction Fine-tuning**: Trains models to follow natural language instructions (e.g., RLHF, Constitutional AI)
    - **Domain Adaptation**: Specializes models for specific fields (e.g., code, legal, medical)
    - **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning**: Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) that update only a small subset of parameters

### Architecture Fundamentals

- **Transformer Architecture**: The dominant architecture for modern LLMs.
    - **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows tokens to attend to other tokens in the sequence, capturing contextual relationships
    - **Multi-Head Attention**: Performs attention operations in parallel across different representation subspaces
    - **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process token representations independently after attention layers
    - **Residual Connections**: Allow gradients to flow through the network more effectively
- **Model Parallelism**: Techniques for distributing model computation across hardware.
    - **Tensor Parallelism**: Splits individual tensors across devices
    - **Pipeline Parallelism**: Assigns different transformer layers to different devices

### Context Window

- **Definition**: The maximum number of tokens an LLM can process in a single forward pass.
    - Measured in tokens (subword units), not characters or words
    - Typical ratios: ~4 characters or ~0.75 words per token for English
- **Attention Mechanisms and Context Length**:
    - Standard attention has quadratic complexity O(nÂ²) with sequence length
    - Extended context models use techniques like:
        - **Sparse Attention**: Attends to only a subset of tokens (e.g., local attention windows)
        - **Linear Attention**: Reformulates attention to have linear complexity
        - **Sliding Window Attention**: Focuses on local contexts with periodic global tokens
- **Context Window Limitations**:
    - Information degradation at long distances within the window
    - Embedding throughput bottlenecks with very large contexts
    - Increased computational load in both VRAM and processing time

## 2. Token Representation and Embeddings

### Tokenization

- **Tokenization Algorithms**: Methods for converting text to token IDs.
    - **BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding)**: Iteratively merges frequent character pairs to form tokens
    - **WordPiece**: Similar to BPE but with likelihood-based merging decisions
    - **Unigram**: Probabilistic approach that optimizes a unigram language model
    - **Tiktoken**: OpenAI's BPE tokenizer optimized for efficiency and determinism
- **Vocabulary Size**: Typical LLMs have vocabularies of 32K-100K tokens.
    - Larger vocabularies can represent more atomic concepts but increase model size

### Vector Embeddings

- **Definition**: Numerical representations of text in a high-dimensional vector space.
    - Typically 768-4096 dimensions for modern models
    - Captures semantic meaning through relative positions in the vector space
- **Embedding Models**: Specialized models for generating high-quality embeddings.
    - **Text Embeddings**: Models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` or HuggingFace's `sentence-transformers`
    - **Code Embeddings**: Specialized models like CodeBERT that better capture programming semantics
- **Distance Metrics**: Methods to measure similarity between embeddings.
    - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors, ignoring magnitude
    - **Euclidean Distance**: Measures straight-line distance in vector space
    - **Dot Product**: Similar to cosine but affected by vector magnitude
- **Dimensionality Considerations**:
    - Higher dimensions capture more nuanced representations but require more storage
    - Techniques like PCA can reduce dimensions while preserving most semantic information
